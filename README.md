1.	Introduction  
The spread of fake news is a major challenge in the digital world, threatening the reliability of information and public trust. . This report presents a semantic classification approach using Word2Vec embeddings and supervised machine learning to detect fake news automatically. The model focuses on understanding the meaning of news text beyond simple word patterns, allowing for more accurate detection.

2. Business Objective
The goal is to construct an automated system that classifies news articles as either true or fake based on their semantic content. This helps combat misinformation by enabling quicker, scalable, and consistent fake news identification, reducing manual verification efforts, and improving public trust in digital media.

3. Problem Statement
Distinguishing fake from real news is challenging due to the growing volume of articles and the subtlety of misinformation patterns. Traditional manual checks are slow and error-prone. The problem is thus a binary classification challenge that requires leveraging textual semantics to flag fake news early and efficiently.
